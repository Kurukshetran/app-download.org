That way your browser only contacts the corrosponding providers if you activly click on one of the grayed out buttons or you set a button to be permanently active. Those providers are: Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA; Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.<br><br>If a button is active and you are currently logged in (or you log in) the corrosponding provider may connect your profile on that social network with the web page on which the button appears. This is done through so called "cookies", small text files that the named providers save on your computer and that can be used to identify you. Even if you aren\'t activly logged in, those providers could connect your profile with the information received through the buttons (for example through your IP address). Further  information about the usage of private data by the named providers can be found in their data privacy statements:  https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/, http://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy, http://twitter.com/privacy.<br><br>If you set a button to be permanently active, your browser sends constantly data to the corrosponding provider. A cookie (socialSharePrivacy_*) will be set  to remember your disicion. By doing so you agree in the sense of the TMG (German Telemedia Act) that the named providers may receive information about you through the buttons. You can revoke that decision at any time by deleting the cookie or by using the menu with a gear on it, near the social media buttons.<br><br>The connection to the named providers is encrypted, however the servers of those providers are often located outside of the european union. Therefore private data is usally not treated properly according to european standards. Furthermore authorities outside Germany may get access to that data through the servers.<br><br>Active buttons are colored (opposed to gray) and the corrosponding switch is active (turned to the right).<br><br>Buttons from Facebook.inc use the Facebook logo (a blue "f" on white background or a "thumps-up" sign). Buttons for Google+ have the sign "+1" or "g+1" on them. Twitter uses a stylized blue bird in the combination with "Twitter", "Tweet" or "Follow".'
